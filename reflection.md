- What are your initial impressions of how `Encapsulation` affects your programming?

I got a better understanding of Java syntax and constructing the code in the language in this assignment compared to the last assignment. Personally, Class Engine worked for me the best in terms of my comprehension of the language because I could put ideas of syntax into most of the pieces in the class.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

As I wrote above, the idea of syntax came to me smoothly this time. I still need to get used to the idea of having a compiler as well as the skills to write proper codes (codes that work) by myself. However, overall, I was doing much better than the last time. I would advise people to take advantage of opportunities to get some help.
